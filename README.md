# Coding Quiz- Web APIs

## Description

This application is a fun challenge to test your skills on JavaScript. 

The application is made to be easy to use and interactive, with display adjustable to screen size. JavaScript, HTML and CSS best practices for file structure and naming conventions were followed. 

While developing this website, I learned about using Javascript language to make a website interactive. I also utilized the Bootstrap CSS library to help develop the application display.
