## Description

This application is a fun challenge to test your knowledge on JavaScript. 

The application is made to be easy to use and interactive, with display adjustable to screen size. JavaScript, HTML and CSS best practices for file structure and naming conventions were followed. 

While developing this website, I learned about web application programming interfaces (web APIs), specifically the Document Object Model (DOM), using JavaScript to make a HTML elements interactive. I utilized the Bootstrap CSS library to help develop the application display. I also learned about the use of local storage in the client's browser, which is utilized to store the user's high scores.
